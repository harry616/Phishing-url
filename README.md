Phishing Detection Website
Phishing is an attack on gullible people by making them disclose their personal and
unique information. It is a cyber-crime where false sites attract exploited people to give delicate
data. This paper describes the various techniques for detecting phishing websites by analyzing
different attributes of URLs with the help of ML techniques.This experimentation discusses the
techniques used for detecting phishing websites by extracting their features like URL length,
port, HTTPS token and many more. We have used data mining techniques for the extraction of
the features of an URL in order to get a clear image of URL's structure that spread phishing. To
protect the end users from entering these types of phished websites, Dr.Phish predicts 
whether an URL is phished or not.
